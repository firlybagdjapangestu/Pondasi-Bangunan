    m_Localized: According to Christady (2014), a foundation is the lowest part of
      a building that transfers the building's load to the soil or rock beneath it.
      According to Yuningtyastuti (2011), a foundation is the lower structure of
      a building that directly interacts with the soil, serving as a component of
      construction that functions to resist the forces exerted upon it. The foundation
      is constructed as a strong fundamental unit beneath the overall structure.

      as its function is to support the structure above it. Therefore, the construction

    m_Localized: The foundation serves to support the entire load of a building and
      transmit this load into the soil below. A foundation system must ensure the
      ability to support the loads of the structure above it, including external
      forces such as wind and seismic forces. Therefore, the foundation must be strong,
      stable, and secure to prevent settlement or failure, as rectifying foundation
      issues can be challenging.
